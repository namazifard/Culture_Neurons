They're great kids; they love their moms and generally speaking, they wouldn't hurt a fly.
They tried to stay away from our house, although none of us has ever hurt a fly.
However, the police didn't want to air their dirty laundry in public, so they covered up the case.
Of course, we were not all friends, but if there was a conflict or a grudge, we tried not to air our dirty laundry in public. In the worst case scenario, we just changed tables to avoid sitting next to each other.
And then, each of them gave in to this visual provocation of hers, no questions asked, and each one of them was ready to jump through hoops not only to surprise her, but to shock her.
If a man really likes a girl, he will jump through hoops to get an opportunity to ask her out, if that is what he desires.
By developing an affinity for drinking, Kuzmich dug his own grave.
By playing dirty, you risk falling into your own trap.
Ultimately, everything is created out of thin air rather than on actual facts.
Admit it, it's much more interesting to listen to a person who's been around than to read a story created out of thin air by an author who has never gotten up from his chair.
The editor, gallery director, customers, and my mom were giving me a hard time for half an hour, grilling me.
If you know you can't help someone, it's better to say "no" than to take their money and then argue with them and return the money, while giving each other a hard time.
Maybe you shouldn't turn to psychology to find the cause, and that's where the heart of the matter lies.
That's the heart of the matter, the bartender interrupted me. "And you said you were happy. How can you be happy when the publisher turned you down?"
No one ever asked for my opinion, so my eyes popped out of my head in surprise, but I put a spoon in my mouth with an air of importance.
The robber was so surprised that his eyes popped out of his head.
He was like a kid in a candy store because of the abundance and variety of goods.
That's how I got to the morning bazaar, where the abundance of delicacies made my head spin.
It wouldn't even occur to you to let some people take care of your children, but there are those you would trust with your life without a second thought.

What if I'm as deaf as a post (there's a certificate)?
She's as deaf as a post. A wonderful woman, by the way.
Ivan and Olga didn't understand each other; it was as if they were on different wavelengths.
Mom, we're on different wavelengths! You tell me one thing, and I tell you something else.
Honey, why do you have to marry him? He's as poor as a church mouse; he has nothing! How will you live together?
Not only is he as poor as a church mouse, but he's also ugly!
I kept thinking that I was as hungry as a bear and kept looking at the door, waiting to be called for lunch.
There's the first cafe, look, it's a vareniki place, I said as cheerfully as possible. "Who's as hungry as a bear?"
And Italians, what can I say, are aristocrats. Blue blood.
We called, made a deal and got in line for a puppy that was due to be born in a couple of months. "Oh, it's going to be blue-blooded!" Dora exclaimed.
We also finished the school prep marathon yesterday. A weight has been lifted from my shoulders. They bought everything.
And then I was immediately relieved; as if a weight had been lifted from my shoulders!
There is no need for that; I think our people have their heads screwed on right.
What about you, Malinin, can't you think for yourself? shouted Kuzyakina.
I would move mountains for you, darling!
And she looked at me again, and I thought that I would move mountains if it would stop her looking so sad again.
To feather your own nest, to stuff yourself, to lie, you don't need to know anything about physics, literature, history...
Maxim Vitalievich is smart; he knows to share and understands that this is more profitable in the end than taking everything to feather his own nest.
Sorry for being a bit harsh. I'm having to take shots in the dark.
Because of my position, I can't be making wild guesses about whether it's true or not.
He pretended to be very busy and studied hard (this was called hitting the books back then).
But the student will also have to hit the books and not avoid the daily grind elsewhere in the dorm or classroom.
Well, yes! You and me are like two peas in a pod, Shurik happily agreed.
It's amazing how soundly you sleep — you don't hear anything, and grandma's the same. You're like two peas in a pod.
But a few days passed, and I realized that I had made a mountain out of a molehill.
I probably made a mountain out of a molehill. I have too many stereotypes in my head.
Just write DENMARK in pretty letters — and it's as good as done.
We paid him the money, and it did the trick!
He was like a dictator, and he ruled his institution with an iron fist.
And life keeps people in a tight grip.
A girl needs to surround herself with a dozen suitors and keep them all on a short leash!
I can see right through them! They're cunning! They need to be kept on a short leash!
Only a person who cannot see further than their nose can see which way the wind is blowing (meaning they can change their principles).
Cynical founders of foundations and curators of modern art who can see which way the wind is blowing are the ones valued nowadays — in one word, people who are not particularly intellectually gifted.
Always keep your finger on the pulse and quickly react to actions.
The feature specific to this stage is that there's an element of assessment involved in all transformations, meaning that the company constantly keeps its finger on the pulse by laying down from the very beginning the result assessment criteria.
Thriving companies that had already been keeping a low profile were in no haste to enter the open markets.
An ordinary person of a similarly low social standing as him would have kept sweeping the floor, washing the bottles and staying in the background his whole life.
They've lost their market share and are now barely staying afloat.
He knew he needed to act quickly and decisively: if he doesn't get rid of all the troubled assets now, his business won't be able to stay afloat much longer.
Many of the asset managers that outperform the market are professionals through and through.
The duke, an aristocrat to the core, was just as shocked as they were that the same death awaited a high-born killer as a lower-class one.
It's better to make several goes at it with a clear head than to keep trying until you're blue in the face and still come up empty.

And I thought I broke my back on the backpack. It's nothing; I'll live.
You are very beautiful and strong. The bleeding will stop shortly, and your cheek will be as good as new in no time.
Because any self-respecting younger brother considers it his duty to drive his older sister up the wall.
Oh, she shouldn't have done that! Doesn't she know that you shouldn't provoke men, let alone make them see red?
They made a sample of a drug that we're supposed to fine tune here and turn into a medication.
An amateur leaps into things but can never bring them to fruition.
Melanie, I didn't get your joke. "Seriously, Richard, you're always so slow on the uptake."
They didn't realize right off what had happened; they're so slow on the uptake.
Mom would often beat the living daylights out of her son when he got bad marks at school.
You shouldn't break the rules in our community, otherwise they'll beat the hell out of you.
The villein was shaking like an aspen leaf and mentally invoked all the saints he could remember.
The little coward was shaking like an aspen leaf.

To get rid of the resentment, you should lay bare your soul.
The farmer and his wife doted upon the youngest sister and were happy with the work she did at the farm.
Grandma was Serbian, a beautiful woman, swarthy, dark-eyed and dark-haired. She doted upon her grandson, and all the family and friends used to say, "He really takes after you."
You gave the leftovers to your layabouts, and the prize-winning lab got a big fat nothing.
That is, he had no age at all; I'm sure that he has a big fat nothing in the Date of Birth field in his passport too.
Soviet power was still alive but on its last legs.
The company was almost on its last legs by then, as its long-term debts had risen to $7.6 billion.
Of course, with so many witnesses, it's as clear as day that the verdict won't be in my favor.
It's as clear as day that eventually such experiments finally convinced the middle-aged naturalist of the detrimental effects of chemical elements.
There's life in the old witch yet, groaned the old woman with a smile; she used to be able to travel very long distances in a matter of minutes thanks to her power.
There's life in the old dog yet, said the old man after having done 30 push-ups.
Our sovereign won't let the grass grow under his feet for sure but will build relations with neighbors and look for allies based on his sovereign interests.
Only 3-5% of clients show the initiative to buy after a great presentation; that's why you shouldn't let the grass grow under your feet but act yourself.
Some people see life through rose-colored glasses and live joyfully, while others look on the dark side and rarely smile.
Times are tough now and you shouldn't look at life through rose-colored glasses.
I've already made plans. I told the secretary that I wouldn't be there on Monday. I want to spend the day with my daughter.
In the meanwhile, a couple of dozen tough guys with knives, bats and brass knuckles set up a meeting where some of the participants will almost certainly be killed.
He gave you a chance to fix it all, but you've made a mess again, and it's so big that we're already fed up with clearing it up.
Why did you kiss her? She has a boyfriend... what a mess you've made.
Okay, I won't tighten the screws yet, and I'll see what the relief worker does; after all, the mistress needs a few good reasons to fire him.
They've started tightening the screws in the country, and now the issue of finding a profitable legal business is at the top of the agenda.
After giving up criminal activities, the lad got a job at a hotel where he was soon promoted to manager.
Of course not! the guy exclaimed. "In fact, I'm giving up alcohol; it only brings trouble."
Going into negotiations unprepared is like deliberately painting yourself into a corner.
It looks like I'd painted myself into a corner so badly that I couldn't get out of there anymore. I lost hope.

I loaded the guns and put them on either side of the main rifle with the intention of making things difficult for any beast who dared approach the house at night.
Thus, you only look down on others, but you don't rise above conventional wisdom and just change the names of things.

Don't get me wrong, I asked without any ulterior motive, innocently.
You've never been sure that his usual outspokenness isn't fraught with an ulterior motive or is a clever trick.
They've always tried to tell me this, and it felt as if this person wanted to hit a raw nerve so that I wouldn't even try.
Some people with ill intentions feel satisfied when they see that their poisonous words hit a raw nerve with the person they were addressed to.
If the guest wasn't invited but just dropped in, things are less complicated.
He liked to drop in, drink some tea and play cards.
Neither of them could imagine then that they'd soon become bosom buddies.
A stranger could easily think that he's looking at a meeting of two bosom buddies.
She learned to play by the rules of upper-class society and easily turned a blind eye to her husband's love affairs.
Can we understand what health is if we turn a blind eye to terrible diseases and epidemics?
They're certainly lying low now, but I bet they'll want to contact us as much as we do.
The best he can hope for is that he'll still be able to escape external surveillance, hide and find a safe place to lie low.
Hereditary obesity in entire families is most often due to the fact that parents pass their eating habits onto their children who then pass them onto theirs, thus forming a vicious circle.
Therefore, a vicious circle is created, and, in the end, the issue remains unsolved.
We carried the girl to the first-aid room and, as our stomachs were already growling with hunger, we sat down to take the edge off our hunger.
For example, you can't drink tap water in a public place that you're visiting for the first time, or yield to the temptation to take the edge off your hunger somewhere in a suburban grocery store where even the window's appearance doesn't stimulate your appetite.
Maybe your team will have to roll up their sleeves, double their efforts and work much more, much harder, much more creatively.
But the difficulties aren't making the task impossible; they just mean that we will all have to roll up our sleeves and get creative.
So they kept talking little by little, and she was genuinely pleased at how he could listen with bated breath, how his long eyelashes moved and his eyes sparkled.
Do you think he's alive? she asked with bated breath.
But the doctor understands that it's the calm before the storm, and he won't be free for long.
She's always afraid to scare away this strange silence that exists in this triangle, but she understands that this is the calm before the storm, before the terrible bloody final.
It was time to tighten the belt and acknowledge the vital dependence of the tribe members on each other to get through tough times.
When you're building your house, raising your children and the whole family is working, you're ready to tighten your belt and work hard if necessary.
You can explain it by giving an example like this: the tribe wanders across the desert in order to find the promised land and encounters an obstacle in the shape of a huge stone on the way to their paradise.
The hut seemed like the promised land; I sent the mortar back to its place, sat down on the porch and tightly closed my eyes trying to control my emotions.
These vipers in the bosom know how to lead girls up the garden path by turning into guys — into an acquaintance if you're waiting for someone, or into a stranger you dream of meeting.
The wife turned out to be a viper in the bosom, and the best friend a traitor.
The supervisor is watching the employees to make sure they don't spend their work time on social media and accidentally google "magic properties of cedar" and other concepts that they should know by heart.
He rarely remembered the athletes' names, but he knew the elements of their programs by heart.
She called "Skyscraper" every day; they told her that everything was fine, but she didn't believe them; she thought they were pulling the wool over her eyes so that she wouldn't panic.
Or are you just deliberately smooth-talking me to drag out the last ball in honor of my visit?
Water delivered in this way becomes worth its weight in gold, and the whole dacha lifestyle circles around the precious moisture.

The director sat on the fence in the dispute between the farmers and the chairmen: he couldn't understand which of them would win and what they would win at all.
I'd been racking my brains for so long, not daring to draw the final conclusions.
Apart from that, we feel broken when we have to rack our brains over a complicated problem or a difficult situation.
Our only interlocutor is the TV, but it's a one-sided game.
Last time was a one-sided game, but this time my training and confidence allowed me to fight back quite successfully.
He kept his stalker at a distance, without showing his face but making it clear that he was still there, just playing cat and mouse.
He got tired of playing cat and mouse, and, as he didn't want to kill him, he made another deceptive trick, lunging at him and piercing his side.
Given the situation her company was in, it was hardly worth playing with fire.
It's dangerous playing with fire, though fire can be of great help for humanity.
Freedom always follows the person's desires like a sheep; that's why mean souls turn it into a powerful weapon of destruction.
Don't get me wrong; I can't follow like a sheep everyone who dares saddle me with their problems!
But, just like you, I decided to brazen it out and made my way to the very head of the press office.
The ability to brazen it out for the sake of victory or knowing how to become sociable at the right moment: is it always a good trait?
This person knows no compassion, craves power and will stop at nothing.
This also means not hurting people, not trying to be a person who stops at nothing in pursuing his goals.
She could already imagine her son following in his father's footsteps and ruining himself in his prime.
Now priests' children were often unwilling to follow in their fathers' footsteps.
To go from zero to hero means to suddenly become rich, for example, to win a huge amount of money.
I've always been fascinated by people who achieve something from scratch, going from zero to hero, and by their success stories.
You're not looking yourself. Has something happened? the general asked anxiously in surprise.
Has anything happened to you? the professor repeated. "You literally don't look yourself!"
You should identify your target audience as accurately as possible, otherwise you'll be doomed to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
After we'd studied the properties and possible side effects on the insert for the prescribed medicines, it became clear that the doctors were using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
Luckily, I didn't have to reinvent the wheel, as I could use someone else's wisdom.
But you don't have to reinvent the wheel to avoid annoying mistakes and miscalculations.
I felt so full of energy at that moment that I would probably have been able to go to the ends of the earth to get that unfortunate buyer.
Should anything happen to the girl, her father will go to the ends of the earth to get revenge.
The daughter makes her father comfortable, smooths out the blanket on the bed, though he's about to breathe his last and the wrinkles on his blanket are unlikely to make him feel uncomfortable.
The steppe dweller breathed his last, falling from the saddle with the captive who he was holding tightly with one hand.
Take any book, any mystic-related movie: the gods have a finger in every pie.
Does that mean that she needs a finger in every pie and set him on the right path?
I didn't bother you; you're the one who stuck to me like glue!
She stuck to her like glue, following her everywhere; they even got into college together.
She stood next to me just a moment ago and then disappeared into thin air.
He went fishing that morning and didn't come back. His wife was worried, alerted her many acquaintances, but her husband had disappeared into thin air.
We've had a load of new holidays out of the blue over the past decade.

He put the case on the table next to the first one, and I swear, they were like two peas in a pod.
They had an unusual crescent moon shape and looked like two peas in a pod.

Any way you slice it, I feel guilt toward the dearest creature in the world.
He's always trying to explain and even show her the things she should know and respond to. And everything is like water off a duck's back to her.
The public is against the project, but it's like water off a duck's back to Fursenko, he doesn't care.

The relatives sobbed; they held mother in place — it was like she was possessed.

The man vanished into thin air without leaving a trace.
We have an informant here, and he knows for sure that you've met him. But after meeting with you, the young man vanished into thin air.
That's why it won't hurt you to learn about those difficulties and obstacles that can happen out of the blue.
It would be okay if he just disappeared; but then he showed up out of the blue.
Walking step by step, one foot in front of the other, in the same direction, will get you further than running around in circles like a madman.
She ran like mad the last meters downhill and stopped just at the water's edge.
Money is a tool, but it becomes a stumbling block as soon as you don't have enough of it.
The issue remained a bone of contention at all congresses, meetings and in the ongoing efforts of the organizations.
A muddle-headed person is unable to discern the essence of the phenomenon, to highlight the main thing — what you need in order to understand the task or problem.
You get in a muddle and are confused.
He's so stubborn that you'll get nowhere with him.
Life experience has shown that you'll get nowhere with English men because they're not ready to get married or spend money on a woman.
That's disgusting, she told her reflection. "And how do you want to wash off the dirt with dirty soap? Fight fire with fire? That's nonsense!"

It was a closed book for the merchants because they often couldn't even find out whether the product was subject to duty.
I don't know anything about her life; she remains a closed book to me.
Motivation to work is external in nature and boils down to the carrot and stick principle: if you do what is expected of you, you get a reward; if not, here is your punishment.
Training with a carrot and stick is like training animals and is based on the development of a conditioned reflex: reward for the right behavior and punishment for the wrong one.
So when will you do it? "When pigs fly," he always replied.
Petrov, when will you hand in your homework? "When pigs fly."

Sasha, you need to do a spring clean, Mother said, looking into the room. "You haven't done a stroke of work. The dust is knee-deep."

The customer's fear, uncertainty and the risk of acquiring a pig in a poke make it necessary to pay more attention to human relationships.
What did you put in the suitcase. Why is it so heavy? I asked, yawning. "You own next to nothing!"
No TVs, no smartphones; entertainment is thin on the ground.

But whatever you say, he's a handsome fellow — the very picture of health, with light brown hair.
The young people were the very picture of health — high-colored, with drops of water on their tanned bodies, illuminated by rays of sunlight; they were beautiful.
Sometimes, it is difficult to determine whether a popular saying was coined by the author and then popularized or, conversely, the author borrowed it from colloquial speech.
A dictionary of popular Latin sayings will tell us that in memorio means "in memory".
The squad performed terribly. Everyone was exhausted and nervous. They forgot their chants and shouted at sixes and sevens. I didn't take to the stage.
So the army went on the attack at sixes and sevens. The outcome was terrible.
But everyone knows that mercenaries literally roll in money when they enter into very lucrative contracts with the same barons!
She has come into possession of a vast fortune and will be rolling in money.
Wait, this story is enough to make a cat laugh. Do you think I really should include everything in the report?
He's a bad warrior and a governor for the birds.
This is often the case: he kills his beloved and then, when he comes to himself, he begins to kick himself.
I can handle it myself, but you'll kick yourself later because you didn't help your only sister — a fragile and defenseless girl.
Now I live from hand to mouth — I don't earn that much.
I know a lot of well-educated people who are unemployed and live from hand to mouth.

Let's spend this evening together. Shall we have a drink? "I don't mind. As for drinking this evening, I'll hold you to it."
Will she ever get out of here or not? Or she is going to be an eyesore all day?

Oleg was not happy to see Sveta's former lover. That's why Oleg sat at the table with a face as black as thunder and downed one shot after another.
Marusya looked at Nosov. His face was as black as thunder. "Why are you sulking?" "I don't like circuses."
A sense of humor is an Achilles' heel for many teachers — they can't all take jokes.
Almost everyone has their own Achilles' heel — a deep-rooted, chronic illness.
They made one mistake after another; they came out unscathed thanks to their high connections and left the country and people to pay off with tears and blood.
Coaches rarely come out unscathed from such losses, especially since nobody has forgotten about the failures in the 2014/2015 season.
He rarely gets excited, preferring instead to get his own way and remain outwardly calm, and he often gets what he wants.
Sometimes our propensity to fight to the end and get our own way prevents us from making peace in the family.

She ran as fast as her legs could carry her to avoid being late for the meeting.

Everything here is fine — everything is going without a hitch.
He was very pleased: everything was going without a hitch.
My girlfriend Valya, it's like the lights are on but nobody's home, ran up to me and started to shake me: "Let's go outside!"
He wasn't stupid, but he wasn't particular smart either. It's like the lights are on but nobody's home, but he's quite savvy in domestic affairs.
She is not just a maverick; she is outcast from the whole team.
The crew, guard, attendants, passengers and accompanying persons... And only Ilya stuck out like a sore thumb casually dressed in jeans, a shirt and light sweater.
Apollinary Ramovich looked at him as if he was mad. "Do you have a screw loose? Well, I see, you're acting nervous and insane!"
Hey woman, do you have a screw loose? You don't know how to walk or to talk.
How's your friend Misha doing? "Don't rub salt into my wound. It pains me to think about him."
The mother stopped asking her son about his private life. She didn't want to rub salt into his wound.
I'm going to wear it only once and then I'll keep it like the apple of my eye.
Following the logic that has survived communist totalitarianism, a politician such as Yushenkov should be cherished like the apple of the eye.
The boss shrugged her shoulders and decided that Olya is spoiled rotten.

I should have guessed right away that they were luring us into a trap. You know, there's no such thing as a free lunch.
There's no such thing as a free lunch, she said angrily. "I've never got anything for nothing in my life."
A hefty man twiddles his thumbs all day on a stool instead of standing behind a machine and making something tangible!
I used to get up at seven in the morning and leave work at six in the evening. I loved feeling like a person who is actually doing something instead of twiddling my thumbs.
He is beating his head against the wall in his hole instead of getting another job and earning some money or getting into a private clinic, as all good doctors do.

I was given a baptism by fire in kindergarten — a hostile baby bit my nose.
Many officers and sergeants received a baptism by fire in the Iran-Iraq war and in endless skirmishes with drug traffickers on the Afghan and Pakistan borders.
The head of the family was a big shot there; he was the mayor, even though he did not live long.
The incident was possibly perpetrated by the daughter of some big shot.

The great, mighty nation pulled a dumb slogan out of a hat and threw it in the face of the whole world.
But then I decided to come to my senses so as not to upset my father and mother.
Properly speaking, it is up to us, mankind, who must finally come to our senses and put in order the huge and overly expensive civilized economy to survive and develop.
The Prince really loved our four-legged friends and funded several shelters and hospitals for animals, both wild and domestic.
But our four-legged friends, in whose lives, by the way, all the same people interfere, are not always able to help themselves.
It could equally mean that he was telling the truth or talking out of his hat.
You're laughing, but I've been listening to this load of hogwash for two hours.
It is hard to believe, but Italians, who are known to be impulsive, don't bat an eye when you're running a red light through four-lane traffic — they simply brake, and that's it.
He wanted to surprise her with his generosity, but she did not bat an eye, and when he turned away, she pursed her lips in contempt.
I must say straight away that I don't want to and I won't take a dig at our medicine, physicians and treatment methods.

Don't believe him, he is a barefaced liar.
She wanted to say it all at once and right now. Lizaveta was about to jump out of the car. But she changed her mind. There was no rush. It wasn't the last time she and Gorny would meet.

He also loves you very much and he will miss you, but you will meet for sure. All in good time.
You didn't ask me if I wanted to listen... And why did you decide that I needed this particular record, and one on top of that? I don't get it. "You will, young man, all in good time."

Something out of the ordinary happened to Illarionych yesterday. He came to the office at lunch as usual, and the boss was already pacing back and forth in a rage because the financial director has signed a foreign exchange contract in violation of the exchange control requirements.
This incident should not be considered as something out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, such things happen quite regularly at our office.
While the company's management was in a state of blissful prostration, this crazy news was quickly spreading among employees, passed on by word of mouth.
Passed on by word of mouth, insidious and dishonest slander was traveling everywhere like a winged dragon.
We'll be afraid to feel toxic shame and toxic guilt; therefore, we will suppress our aggression and will become convenient to the people around. We'll deny ourselves spontaneity and put a lid on our impulses.

He was always trying to give you his advice, which only he considered logical and clear, enabling one to start with a clean slate. Oh, if only it really were that simple.
High society does not accept ready-made proverbs, because they are scenes from a life alien to it, and in a foreign language; nor does the society make up its own proverbs, perhaps out of politeness and social decency, because a proverb hits the nail on the head.

Because of your incredible stubbornness, you see nothing further than the end of your nose, Kitaev summarized sadly, taking the notebook with his notes away from the table.

This show is not for the faint-hearted! Bogdan announced with a roguish smile. "Hold on tight to your chairs!"

She won the first round and lost the second one. The end of the tournament is still a very long way off. Thus, as regards the victory, God only knows that.
All this is old wives' tales. You may just as well say that one mustn't show a child to anyone until he turns one month. "To be honest, I used to figure as much."
Stop believing old wives' tales! You can't take everything at face value! "I'm just used to trusting people."
What could be better than walking in the woods in an Indian summer? The last warm days before the cold and rainy fall...
What nice weather! Mikhail said. "A real Indian summer! I wonder how long it will last."
You shouldn't reopen old wounds; let's just forget about it as if nothing has happened.
I thought you would be smarter and not reopen old wounds. I think it still hurts her to remember it.
The trainer said: "Don't go for two goals at once, hammer away at one point! It's the surest way to succeed".
We must unite our efforts and hammer away at the same point if we want to finish building the website on time.
It sucks, boss! This isn't going to work. We need to change our tactics. "Yes, I can see that."
His health is still in the toilet. If he keeps neglecting himself, everything could end badly.
I'm scared of getting involved in all this mess... "Just trust me: if you do everything I tell you, you'll have money to burn!"
She has always had money to burn. But she never knew how to spend it. She has always been a real spender.

Do you think I have a chance of winning the main prize? Oh, don't hold your breath! Of course, you're talented, but you should sensibly assess your strengths.

We'll still have to blame the scientists for deficiencies and the powers that be for serious, sometimes culpable faults in their work.
The history of the labor movement contains examples of much more brutal violence by the powers that be, which turned out to be completely pointless.
A stingy person puts money first. It is almost sacred for him. This is why any proposal to spend it is so painful for him.
Humanistic psychology puts human beings front and center, focusing on their potential for self-actualization and personality development.
Borneo, or more precisely, a journey across this tropical island of Indonesia was his pipe dream. He wanted to see these ancient tropical forests, impenetrable jungles and endless mountains.
It is precisely because of the biological incompatibility with human nature that socialist ideals will remain a pipe dream of humanity, unattainable in real life.
It is impossible to move forward without cutting this Gordian knot. Timofey said grievously, tugging nervously on his beard. "Either we solve the problem regarding access to the updated versions right now, or will be eaten by our competitors."
So you, dear Klim Ivanovich, untie... this... Gordian knot, please!
If someone's liver is bruised, this person is as good as dead. He will get weaker, begin to cough up blood, won't be able to eat and drink and will eventually kick the bucket.
But when the mighty die, a railroad conductor or someone from management, we say they have kicked the bucket. So they say: "Have you heard? He kicked the bucket."
Trying to hide his disappointment under a mask of calmness, Ivan Petrovich put on a brave face and briskly headed towards us.
You're putting a brave face on a bad situation again! Savely said indignantly. "I'm well aware of the scale of the disaster. The company is on the brink of collapse, and you're telling us that everything is fine."
But alas! Even Homer sometimes nods. The poor bridegroom got carried away by his future happiness and in the heat of his fantasies, he blurted out that he got a salary of a mere two and a half rubles.
Well, even Homer sometimes nods, I resented. "It can happen to anyone."
Stop fooling around, the work is waiting for us, he said, spurring his team as it was relaxing after the siesta.
Supposing another place is still there, she replied. "Besides, all this is unreal... Isn't it strange for you to fool around when real life is so harsh?"
The idea of the government's power was so deeply hammered home to the faceless, disciplined officers, they grew numb from the mere presence of the top management.
Mass media have hammered miracle surgeries home to people, and they only advertise surgeons.
Today, the whole town somehow looks upside down and inside out; maybe because I left my favorite glasses at home.
Before the holidays, everything is always upside down in our office: everyone fusses about, unable to work peacefully.
Lyusya, don't be offended, but I can't expose my private life as you do. And I don't like to chatter with everyone about things that are still up in the air.
What did I get myself into? It's still up in the air whether I will marry him, but he has already left me no choice.
The two key ideas woven through the book Spare are Prince Harry's love for his mother and his hatred of the yellow press. In fact, these things are interconnected, considering the circumstances of Lady Diana's death.
Of course, if you trust the attention-hungry yellow press, the apex of the supernatural will be exactly physical manifestations such as ghosts or haunted houses.
Imagine, I do not know my part, she said, looking into the notebook. "I will certainly mess up. So, the die is cast," she continued, very worried. "The die is cast..."
The die is cast, he said. "God's servant Vasily is ordained as a literary psalm reader... God willing, he will thrive."
This villain has nothing, not a penny to his name! stormed Egor Kuzmich. "And you are listening at the edge of your seat, you took him in, turned him into an equal partner... A good co-investor, the cursed beggar!"
If there is anyone without a penny to his name, it is probably Fedor Stepanovich. That's because in his youth, he successfully lost all of his father's hefty inheritance to horse races.
Well, I meant well... "Give advice only when you are asked. Until then, you can take your advice and shove it!"
I warned mom that I would be back the next morning. Mom waved her hand and told me to hit the road and take care.
The creek by which they set up their temporary camp turned into a small river swarming with fish just a short distance away.
Maybe they used to dump trash here and now it's swarming with rats, all kinds of bugs and fat worms down there.
This site is just a treasure trove of knowledge; it contains an incredibly huge data base.
At that time, there were not so many sources of new information and, believe it or not, even the Internet was not an inexhaustible treasure trove of knowledge.
Well, yes, that is right—if we do not provide for the future now, we will have to tighten our belts collectively some time down the line.
The flour is enough for a week or two: flatbreads are steaming on the stove, mash soup is in the cauldron, pancakes fried in fish oil are sizzling in the pan—all you can eat! Come on in, whoever wishes to, and help yourself! Then stop—and tighten your belt...
No, thanks, he replied; he was a real bundle of nerves.
Her heart danced in her chest with joyful excitement, but her whole body was tense, like a bundle of nerves, and she felt that she was about to fall.
And if it happens that, at some point, you start pushing for your rights and saying that this state of affairs doesn't satisfy you, in such a case he may give you a fitting rebuff.
Follow the advice, young man, scornfully prompted the first girl, with a flicker of unconcealed scorn in her eyes. "And don't ever think of pushing for your rights, flexing your muscles and arguing it."
Have you only just found out that the child is now the math teacher's scapegoat and therefore is not sleeping and lost his appetite?
This would have the ring of truth if the directors themselves did not seek a scapegoat for their bad management and persistence in building the canal that clearly had to make way for a railroad.
Are you kidding? My boss will have a stroke as soon as he sees that his subordinate has a car with a chauffeur. I'd rather call a taxi.
I will! the prince sprang to his feet, staggered and gripped hold of the notary. "You see, my father has already had a stroke because of my marriage! And what's the big deal, a stroke? He told me to get married, and so I will!"
I'll be honest with you; I am an adventurer by nature. I find it boring just to idle my life away. I want some kind of excitement that I haven't experienced as yet.
Sometimes I really manage to forget him, to bury this malicious rascal in oblivion, but he is still idling his life away.
Trying to explain to him why he should act exactly this way is a fool's errand, if ever there was one! This man is obstinate as a mule and always turns a deaf ear to everyone.
And it was just as impossible to recognize why she had been in a bad mood for several days now, why she felt tired, and the whole huge, sometimes painful training work seemed to be a fool's errand.
In my childhood, when Mom wanted to enroll me into a music school, the teacher who auditioned me said that I had a real tin ear.
I've had a tin ear since childhood; when I sang, they said I was howling like a lunatic. But my pushy mother enrolled me in a choir and, in so doing, she signed the choir's death warrant.
You should not grant the attorney the right to do them a disservice by initiating criminal proceedings in 'their interests' against their wishes.
If we bring up a child through rewards and punishments, we will do him more harm than good and mislead him as to the way of the world.
I understood how unpleasant it was for him, as he found himself between the devil and the deep blue sea, but his position did not let him say what he wanted to.
I remember perfectly well why I moved out from my relatives. Because it's impossible to be stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea day and night.
They all illustrate an indisputable truth: when faced with something unusual and unfamiliar abroad, people sometimes misjudge it due to their instinctive susceptibility to measuring others by their own yardstick.
To come to know a foreign country, you should break the habit of measuring others by your own yardstick.
They were a repercussion of the postwar years when, after the amnesty, a lot of people were freed from durance vile.
I cannot forget him, given that you sent him up the river; by the way, how did you manage to do it then?
As for me, I tirelessly fought for my place in the sun but never felt the warmth of its illusive rays.
Here and there inside this maze are scattered small squares with countless nooks and crannies, where pickpockets, cripples, drunks, vagrants, and dogs are all fighting for their place in the sun.
Probably, having evaluated the level of the guests' language proficiency, he just did not want to cast his pearls before swine.
Eventually, tiring of her one-syllable 'yes' and 'no' answers, uttered as if she was being forced to cast her pearls before swine, I gave up my fruitless efforts and started swallowing my supper in gloomy silence matching her own.
Very clever people can be honest for convenience sake and act with honesty where people with limits will be trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.
Pulling the wool over people's eyes expertly, isn't he, said Chepurin.
What a fool's dream, she smiled, looking through multicolored pebbles, beads and small glass balls.
And everywhere you see ads, ads, ads—your chance to make a fool's dream come true.
I wish these people felt respect for you because they aren't fit to hold a candle to you, but how do you sustain yourself?
And you, getting a twenty-kopeck coin on the twentieth for a dirty trick, put on your uniform and light-heartedly bully them, the people to whom you are not fit to hold a candle, who won't let you in their hallway.
So that's the catch—I'm just not used to having fun, I joked. "I definitely need a goal, an objective!"
In Soviet society, there are no such social mechanisms and conditions that would guarantee the exercise of freedoms in a form that is adequate to their wording—that's the catch.
A raving beast appeared out of him; it was ready to jump down the throat of the enemy and revel in the rage of the battle as if it were a fine wine.
I have a wild boost of energy and an uncontrollable wish to jump all over my enemies.
Grandma used to get up early and go to bed with the chickens.
The neighbor went to bed with the chickens, insisting on total silence. It was a true ordeal for me, as I was used to going to bed late.
My parents taught me that any lie is a sin. Even if it's what they call a "white lie."
Even the smallest lie or a white lie inevitably leads to another lie. And then a person can't stop and keeps on lying.
Initially I thought that it was a pointless idea. But in about half a year, things started moving - our band started to gain recognition.
Have things started moving? "Yes! Our child finally got his first A in Russian!"
No matter how hard you try, there will always be someone to put a fly in the ointment.
Everything seemed to be going according to plan, but there was a fly in the ointment.
She barks at the moon trying to prove the obvious. It feels like nothing can stop her.
Endlessly trying to prove this theory is like trying to reinvent the wheel.
The guy is completely hammered! "Tell me about it! What a disgrace, getting so drunk so early in the morning!"
These two have been wasted since morning and can barely stand up.
And so, you have to toil away all your life, whether you like it or not.
He has to provide for his family somehow, so he keeps toiling away and does his best not to complain.
There is no point in sitting and waiting for manna from heaven—happiness is something you build with your own hands.
I cannot promise you any manna from heaven, but you will definitely gain some extra income.
Do not lump it all together; try to understand the meaning of these terms.
No one bothered to look for a connection between these two events. Of course, it was easier to just lump it all together.
Stop cursing! Can't you see she's welling up with tears? You're a mean person, you know!
When Sasha hears such sad stories, his eyes always well up with tears.
No one arrested him; he was just detained for verification of identity. Stop making a fuss and go home!
The husband asked Alina, "Could you stop making a fuss prematurely and wait for the test results?"
She has been very stubborn since childhood, always trying to have her way and prove her point.
If not for this incident, Asya would keep sticking to her image of an offended girl whom no one understands.
I have so many things to do that my head is spinning. After all, I am not a multitasker, it's hard for me to handle all this load.
Her head was spinning from the complex mathematical formulas the teacher was trying to explain.
She was a real tough cookie who could accomplish any goal.
Do you think she needs your help? She is a tough cookie and can do everything herself.
Do not mention this subject, it hits a nerve for her. It's best not to bring up the past.
She went red in the face. The teacher's clearly hit a nerve.
Don't try to shift the blame—deal with your problems yourself. I have enough of my own difficulties.
Your request for help looks like an attempt to shift the responsibility.
Do you think I'm fooling around? I'm actually doing something important here. I'm doing all I can for you!
What's this got to do with it? Why are you fooling around? Stop talking nonsense!
Life expectancy was short then, and people often died in their prime.
Not many remembered this old man at the peak of his fame, as he was over 90 now.
I thought it was going to work out just fine, but I was wrong; in the end, it was completely different from my original intention.
If you are able to make a good impression on the manager, it's as good as done, and the job is basically in your pocket.
As soon as my buddy smelled trouble, he was gone in an instant. And I was left to deal with the fallout.
Judging from the test results, we are about to run into real trouble... I wish I had something to reassure you.
You let them go, and they'll be gone with the wind. No, it's best to deal with this issue right away.
You need to take the opportunity while they are still here. You lose your chance now, and you can kiss it goodbye forever.
The detective threatened the suspect that if he kept protesting his rights, he'd get sentenced easy as pie.
It seemed like it would be a piece of cake to figure a way out of this situation. If only.
As sure as death, they will see us, Gosha said. "Don't jinx it, they won't notice! We'll be careful," Petya replied.
As sure as death, it will take a few more days to finish the work.
They had been living in clover with the parents until his wife said she wanted move out.
Just look at him, he's settled in like a pig in clover and still has something to grumble about!

Stepan got angry: "I'll raze your village to the ground if you stand in my way!"
I don't get scared easily, but this story makes my blood curdle. What a story.
The boy realized that he had done something awful. The tutor's look made his blood curdle.
The actor thought it was his last appearance—in all likelihood, it was his swan song.
He wrote his swan song back in his youth, anticipating his imminent death.
You shouldn't believe everything broadcast by state-sponsored propaganda; all this concern for the security of the country and its citizens is just crocodile tears!
We always weep crocodile tears over corruption, over criminality. But these are not the things to start with! No law enforcement methods can defeat sin, while corruption and criminality result from human sin.
Sometimes tasty morsels appeared, but sometimes there was not a single satisfactory target to choose from.
The cells of the mucous membrane in the respiratory tract in general and of nasal mucous membranes in particular are a real honeypot for a lot of viruses.

They're paying us peanuts again, Dmitry Sergeyevich grumbled, looking at the payslip. "Where's our bonus?"
In the hungry nineties, Lyonya had a job on the side as a freight handler at a high-end grocery store on Novy Arbat, where in addition to his salary he used to get the crumbs from the master's table — expired products ready for disposal.
We decided to skip that tender. They offered a huge amount of work and paid peanuts; it was clearly more trouble than it's worth.
Oh, it was more trouble than it's worth, Valera, the foreman, muttered as he put the broken Chinese drill into the dumpster.
Ivan was tempted to tell his boss to get lost and quit, solving all the problems that had piled up at work in one fell swoop.
Just look at that! Trushkin boasted of his successful throw. "All seven in one fell swoop!"
All these bourgeois are cut from the same cloth, Timofey said as usual, scolding the authorities. "No matter what happens, our capitalists will always come to an agreement with the Western leaders and live like kings, while all the hardships of war will be left to us, the ordinary Russian people."
Alright, sit down. We have nothing to quarrel over. We are cut from the same cloth.
Listen, pal, Ivanov said. "You and I, we move in the same circles, we're hard workers, and it's much easier for us to come to an agreement than our wretched bosses. Let's not complicate things!"

You're really like two peas in a pod, pals, Pelageya laughed when she met both Sidorovs in the sanatorium lobby. "You think and act in sync."

Stop screaming bloody murder! Aunt Klava took out a jar and filled the cat's bowl with food. "Eat, Barsik, my little gray one!"

Yeah, we got off lightly, Igor muttered as he pulled over and got out of the car, heading to the overturned truck on the other side of the road. "Tima, call an ambulance; I think someone's hurt."
You know, Alexey, I'm afraid our car will kick the bucket soon enough, Dmitry Petrovich looked at his careless driver in disapproval. "It's extremely dangerous to put in this fuel without any special additives in a modern diesel engine."
