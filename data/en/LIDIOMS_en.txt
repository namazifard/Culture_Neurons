a bigwig
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
a bitter pill to swallow
a cold day in hell
a fish rots from the head down
a friend in need
a short fuse
a shot in the dark
a skeleton in the closet
a stone's throw
a voice crying in the wilderness
actions speak louder than words
add insult to injury
all in the same boat
all sizzle and no steak
all that glitters is not gold
all the way to egery and back
arm and a leg
as old as the hills
at the drop of a hat
back on one's feet
back to square one
back to the drawing board
be glad to see the back of
be in seventh heaven
beat a dead horse
beat around the bush
beck and call
behind the scenes
behind the times
bend over backwards
bet your bottom dollar
birds of a feather flock together.
bit the bullet
bite off more than you can chew
bite your tongue
blessing in disguise
bone of contention
bonehead
bored to death
bow and scrap
brand-new
brass monkey weather
break the ice
butterflies in my stomach
buy a lemon
by hook or crook
by the book
call it a night
calm before the storm
can't judge a book by its cover
cast in the same mould
cat got your tongue?
catch 22
caught with one's hand in the cookie jar
come a long way
company in distress makes sorrow less
cross that bridge when you come to it
cry over spilt milk
crème de la crème
cut corners
cut it out!
cut the mustard
cut to the chase
devil's advocate
don't count your chickens before they've hatched
don't cry over spilt milk
don't look a gift horse in the mouth
don't put all your eggs in one basket
don't toot your own horn.
don't wash your dirty laundry in public
down the drain
draw the short straw
dumb as a post
east or west, home is best
elvis has left the building
every dog has his day
every which way
fall between two stools
far cry from
feel the pinch
feeling a bit under the weather
fight fire with fire, one fire drives out another
finding a needle in a haystack
from the horse's mouth
get laid
get over it
give credit where credit is due.
give the third degree, give a sound trashing
give up the ghost
god forbid.
good samaritan
hard work never hurt anyone.
haste makes waste.
have an ax to grind
have finger in too many pies
have two pennies to rub together
head over heels
hear it on the grapevine
heart of gold
high five
hit the books
hit the nail on the head
hit the sack / sheets / hay
hocus pocus
hold one's breath
hold your tongue back
honest to god!
hopping mad
hot potato
hot water
i'll eat my hat if...
in ages
in dire straits
in the blink of an eye
in the fast lane
it doesn't hurt to ask
it's a small world
it's greek to me.
its raining cats and dogs
jack of all trades
juggle frogs
keep something at bay
keep your eye on the ball
keep your fingers crossed!
kick the bucket
kill two birds with one stone
know like the back of your hand ?
lame duck
land on one's feet
lend a hand
let sleeping dogs lie
let the cat out of the bag
listen!
live and learn
long shot
long time, no see!
look alive!
look before you leap
look like a million dollars
loose cannon
lose one's train of thought
lose sleep over it
lose your head
lose your shirt
love is blind
made your bed, now lie
make a long story short
make hair stand on end
method to my madness
misfortunes never come singly
miss the boat
money talks
muddy the waters
mum's the word.
mumbo jumbo
naked truth
narrow escape
neck and neck
neither a borrower or a lender be.
neither fish nor fowl
nest egg
nip and tuck
no flying from fate
no pain no gain
none of your business
not a spark of decency
not playing with a full deck
off one's guard
off one's rocker
off the hook
old chicken makes good soup
old hand
on cloud nine
on one's own
on the pig's back
once bitten, twice shy.
once in a blue moon
once in a while
one card shy of a full deck
one good turn deserves another.
out of sight, out of mind.
out of the blue
over my dead body
over the top
packed (in) like sardines
pandora's box
penny for your thoughts
penny-pincher
picture paints a thousand words
piece of cake
play second fiddle
poker face
popping out
pull someone's bacon out of the fire
pull the cat's tail
pull the plug
pull the wool over one's eyes
pulling someone's leg
put salt on his tail
put the cart before the horse
red in the face
reinvent the wheel
rock the boat
roll up one's sleeves
rome wasn't built in a day!
run into the sand
scapegoat
scatterbrain
scratch head
see eye to eye
see light at the end of the tunnel
shake a leg
shoot the breeze
shy away from a daring task
slap on the wrist
sleep on it
smell a rat
snake in the grass
snug as a bug in a rug
speak of the devil!
speak off the cuff
spill the beans
start from scratch
take it easy
take the wind out of someone's sails
talk hot air
talk the hind legs off a donkey
talking to a brick wall
taste of your own medicine
that's for the birds.
that's the heart of the matter.
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
the ball is in your court
the bottom line
the early bird gets the worm
the ends justifies the means
the forbidden fruit is the sweetest
the icing on the cake
the last straw
the odd one out
the penny dropped,
the shoemaker's son always goes barefoot
the straw that broke the camel's back
the whole nine yards
there is many a slip between cup and lip
there's no smoke without fire
third wheel
three sheets to the wind
throw a spanner in the works
throw the baby out with the bathwater
time out
tip of the iceberg
tit for tat
to be at the end of one's rope
to be broke
to be green with envy
to be on the ball
to bite the dust
to do one's utmost
to have your cake and eat it, too.
to not be made of money.
to paint the town red
to place the cherry on top
to progress by leaps and bounds
to rub salt in the wound
to throw a monkey wrench in the works
to throw cold water on something
to twiddle one's thumbs
tomorrow is another day
too many cooks spoil the broth
toss-up
tough nut to crack
turn a blind eye
turn a deaf ear
twenty-four/seven
united we stand, divided we fall.
up a creek without a paddle
walk on thin ice
water under the bridge
whale of a time
what’s eating you?
when pigs fly
while there is life there is hope.
wouldn't be caught dead
you bet!
you can bet your life on that 
you couldn't split them apart with water/as thick as thieves
you reap what you sow
your belly button is bigger than your stomach
your guess is as good as mine
zero tolerance
zip your lip
