In addition, in Chinese culture, there is often a long-term perspective that values stability and continuity, rather than short-term gains. Breaking rules for short-term gains may be seen as sacrificing long-term stability and success for immediate benefits, which is not in the best interest of the organization as a whole.

Overall, I would expect that the attitude towards breaking company rules, even if the employee thinks it is in the organization's best interest, would be negative in Chinese culture, with a tendency to strongly agree or agree with the statement.
